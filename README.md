## What is this?

Ever wondered how many custom emojis your Slack workspace has? Curious about the most common words in emoji names, or whether your teammates prefer GIFs or static images? Want to see who creates the longest-named emojis? Youâ€™re in the right place.

This dashboard takes your Slack emoji data (not usage!) and turns it into a smorgasbord of dazzling charts, fun facts, and interactive elements. Any Slack user can use it, and the app runs ok browser local storage entirelyâ€”nothing is stored on any server. 


## Why would you build this?

Every company I've worked at has had one thing in common: an extremely robust library of custom Slack emojis.
